Great job taking a hard idea and figuring out how to make it a little bit easier to achieve. It is a very hard problem to take a hard project and figure out how to make a first-draft “prototype”, so great job. I am glad you figured out how to link to TinEye for a “reverse image search.” The one thing I am a little bit unclear about is what happens when I upload a photo - you don’t display it on the screen for me or, it seems, do anything with it. It would be nice to know what happens when I upload a photo =).

As a user interface suggestion, I would try to give the user as much feedback as possible, like for example showing me the photo that you ask me to upload. Great job with the code also - it looks nice and organized.
